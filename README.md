## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to make custome sliders and toggle switches. Also, I got a better grasp of CSS Grid.

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->

### Continued development

- [Custom Toggle Switch](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp) - I used a modified version of this to create the toggle switch.
- [CSS Grid Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU&t=1178s) - I found this video pretty helpful for the grid section.
